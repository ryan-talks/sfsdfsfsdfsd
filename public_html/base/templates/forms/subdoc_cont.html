    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Before purchasing an Interest in the Millennial Assets Limited, prospective investors should carefully consider various risk factors and conflicts of interest, as well as suitability requirements, restrictions on transfer and withdrawal of Interests and various legal, tax and other considerations. An investment in the Interests offered by the Millennial Assets Limited should be viewed as a non-liquid investment and involves a high degree of risk. These Interests are not subject to regulatory oversight.</p>

      <li>
        <p> With respect to any person, any individual or entity that would be a U.S. Person under Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;). The Regulation S definition of U.S. Person includes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p> Any natural person resident in the United States;</p>

          <li>
            <p> Any partnership or corporation if organized or incorporated under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction; and formed by a U.S. person principally for the purpose of investing in securities not registered under the Act, unless it is organized or incorporated, and owned, by accredited investors (as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act) who are not natural persons, estates or trusts.</p>
            
            <p> For purposes of the foregoing, the term &ldquo;United States&rdquo; means the United States of America, its territories and possessions, any state of the United States or an enclave of the United States government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and the District of Columbia.
