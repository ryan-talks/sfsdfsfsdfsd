    <p> <span class="u">Representations by Entities Governed by ERISA</span>. In the event that the Subscriber is governed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (<span class="b u">&ldquo;ERISA&rdquo;</span>), the person executing this Agreement on behalf of the Subscriber represents and warrants as follows:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p> <span class="u">Named Fiduciary</span>. Such person is either a named fiduciary of the Plan (as defined in Section 402(a)(2) of ERISA) or an investment manager of the Plan (as defined in Section 3(38) of ERISA) with full authority under the terms of the Plan and full authority from all Plan beneficiaries, if required, to cause the Plan to invest in the Fund and to execute this Agreement. Such investment has been duly approved by</p>
        
        <p> all other named fiduciaries whose approval is required, if any, and is not prohibited or restricted by any provisions of the Plan or of any related instrument.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> <span class="u">ERISA Requirements Satisfied Fully</span>. As a named fiduciary or investment manager, such person has independently determined that the investment by the Plan in the Fund satisfies all requirements of Section 404(a)(1) of ERISA, and will not be prohibited under any of the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code. The undersigned has requested and received all information from the Investment Manager that it, after due inquiry, considered relevant to such determinations. In determining that the requirements of Section 404(a)(1) are satisfied, the undersigned has taken into account (i) that there is a risk of a loss of the Plan&rsquo;s investment; (ii) that an investment in the Fund will be relatively illiquid, and funds so invested will not be readily available for the payment of employee benefits; (iii) that the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio will not be diversified; (iv) the cash flow requirements and funding objectives of the Plan; and (v) the Plan&rsquo;s other investments. Taking these factors, and all other factors relating to the Fund into account, the undersigned has concluded that investment in the Fund constitutes an appropriate part of the Plan&rsquo;s overall investment program.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> <span class="u">Notification of Changes to Plan</span>. Such person will notify the Investment Manager, in writing, of (i) any termination, substantial contraction, merger or consolidation of the Plan, or transfer of its assets to any other plan, (ii) any amendment to the Plan or any related instrument that materially affects the investments of the Plan or the authority of any named fiduciary or investment manager to authorize Plan investments; and (iii) any alteration in the identity of any named fiduciary or investment manager, including itself, who has the authority to approve Plan investments.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> <span class="u">No Advice from Investment Manager</span>. Such person acknowledges that neither the Investment Manager nor any of its Affiliates render any investment advice on a regular basis pursuant to a mutual understanding, arrangement or agreement, written or otherwise, between the Plan and any of such parties who will act in regard to the Fund and none of such parties renders any investment advice to the Plan that furnishes the primary basis for investment decisions with respect to assets of the Plan.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> <span class="u">Limit on Investment Manager Duty as Fiduciary</span>. If the Investment Manager or any partner, employee or agent of the Investment Manager is ever held to be a fiduciary, it is agreed that, in accordance with the provisions of Section 405(b)(1), 405(c)(2), and 405(d) of ERISA, the fiduciary responsibilities of such persons shall be limited to his or its duties in administering the business of the Fund, and he or it shall not be responsible for any other duties with respect to the Plan (specifically including evaluating the initial or continued appropriateness of the Plan&rsquo;s investment in the Fund under Section 404(a)(1) of ERISA).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> <span class="u">Investment Manager Right to Force Plan Withdrawal</span>. It is further understood that anything contained in the Fund Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at any  time the Investment Manager, in its sole discretion, determines that the continued participation by the Plan in the Fund could cause a violation of any of the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, the Investment Manager may require the Plan to withdraw in whole or in part from the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Fund Agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed to impose any responsibility on the Investment Manager to determine whether investment in the Fund satisfies the requirements of Section 404(a)(1) of ERISA, or to relieve the undersigned or any other fiduciary of responsibility for preventing the Plan from violating the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <span class="u">Change of Status to Benefit Plan Investor</span>. If applicable, the Subscriber has identified its status as a Benefit Plan Investor.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <span class="u">Insurance Company Subscribers</span>. If the Subscriber is an insurance company and is investing the assets of its general account (or the assets of a wholly owned subsidiary of its general account) in the Fund, it has identified whether the assets underlying the general account constitute &ldquo;plan assets&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 401(c) of ERISA. The Subscriber agrees to immediately notify the Investment Manager in writing if there is a change in the percentage of the general account&rsquo;s assets that constitute &ldquo;plan assets&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 401(c) of ERISA and shall disclose such new percentage ownership.</p>

The Fund and its Affiliated Persons shall be held harmless and indemnified against any Loss arising as a result of a failure to process this Subscription Agreement or a redemption application if such information has been required by the parties referred to and has not been satisfactorily provided by the Subscriber. Subscriber represents that all subscription payments transferred to the Fund originated directly from a bank or brokerage account in the name of Subscriber.

Subscriber also represents that it does not have the intention or obligation to sell, distribute or transfer the Interest, directly or indirectly, to any other person or entity or to any nominee account.
